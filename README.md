# Kaggle Competition
## [Zillow Prize: Zillow’s Home Value Prediction (Zestimate)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1)

The goal of this project is to develop an algorithm that makes predictions about the future sale prices of homes. Submissions are evaluated on Mean Absolute Error between the predicted log error and the actual log error. The log error is defined as
logerror=log(Zestimate)−log(SalePrice)
and it is recorded in the transactions training data.
